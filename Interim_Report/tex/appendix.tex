% e.g., User Manuals, supporting evidence for claims made in the main part of the dissertation (e.g. a copy of a user evaluation questionnaire), samples of test data, etc. Note that Appendices are optional.

\chapter{Meeting Minutes}

As stated in Section [RESOURCE MANAGEMENT], project related resources are managed through Git version control. The meeting minutes, for example, can be found at \url{https://github.com/Jizhou-Che/Dissertation/blob/master/Log/Minutes.log}. To provide evidence of my leading role in the meetings and regular progress, however, the meeting minutes until present are presented below.
