\begin{abstract}

Unlike schema-rich knowledge bases which focus a lot on the definitions of terminologies and their relationships, a typical dataset records numerous data entries which fall into those terminologies. In an ontology, such terminologies are represented as classes, and data entries are represented as instances of those classes. To perform integration between datasets, both the schema and the data entries should be matched together, which can be done by matching the classes and instances from their respective ontologies. While matching systems for classes have evolved a lot in recent years, instance matching remains immature. This project investigates into the additional information that can be extracted from ontologies, and explores the possibility of using a reasoning-based approach to automatically deduct the relationships between ontology entities from those information. An automated reasoning-based ontology matching system was built and evaluated using real-world ontologies and reference alignments, including official ones used in the ontology alignment evaluation campaigns. Precision and recall rates were calculated and compared with major ontology matching systems. The overall evaluation results showed great matching precision and satisfying recall, F-measure and time complexity. This system can serve as a basement for real-world data integration tasks.
