\begin{abstract}

An ontology provides a common vocabulary for people who need to share information in a domain (Noy and McGuinness, 2001). Different datasets can be integrated by matching them to the same ontology such that they can be used together for a real world application. For example, data from different sources can be used together to make decisions in city infrastructure management. This project aims to develop an automated ontology-based method for integrating real world datasets.
